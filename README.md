# Research of videogamesâ€™ market for an online store
In the upcoming project, our main task is to identify the factors which determine the sales of video games each year. Then, based on these factors, we will try to predict sales for the upcoming year. Our customer is the worldwide video games store and it provided us with data of game sales for the past 35 years. The dataset includes the title of the game, the released platform, the year of release, the genre, the rating of critics and users, the age rating, and the number of sales around the world, divided by region.

Our research will include the following steps:

1) Finding the most popular gaming platforms.

3) Creating portraits of average users in different regions.

4) Estimating how the scores of critics and users affect the sales of games.

5) Testing two hypotheses:

 - games released on XOne and PC platforms have the same user scores;
 - game genres sports and action have different user scores.

6) Draw conclusions based on the conducted study.

For this project, we used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, math.
